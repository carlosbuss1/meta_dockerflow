# Taxonomic Analysis Pipeline Overview

This repository provides a Python-based pipeline to analyze taxonomic data, calculate summary statistics, and generate visualizations. It is containerized using Docker for reproducibility, ensuring consistent results across different environments. The pipeline includes a sample dataset (`taxonomic_data.csv`) for testing and supports user-defined taxonomic data.

---

## Features

- **Reproducible Environment**: Leverages Docker for an isolated and consistent computational environment.
- **Flexible Input**: Works with user-defined taxonomic data in CSV format.
- **Organized Outputs**: All results are saved to the `output/` directory for easy access.
- **Customizable Analysis**: Easily extendable for various taxonomic or ecological datasets.
- **Visualization**: Generates bar charts for intuitive data presentation.
- **Robust Debugging**: Includes solutions for common issues such as permission errors, volume management, and file handling.

---

## Tasks Performed

1. **Data Input Validation**:  
   - Reads and validates the structure of the input file (`taxonomic_data.csv`).
   - Ensures proper formatting for downstream tasks.

2. **Taxonomic Analysis**:  
   - Calculates total species count for each taxonomic phylum.  
   - Computes average species count per species within each phylum.

3. **Result Generation**:  
   - Outputs processed results to the `output/` directory.  
   - Provides insights suitable for visualization or further statistical analysis.

4. **Visualization**:  
   - Generates a bar chart showing total species count per phylum.

5. **Reproducibility**:  
   - Fully automated via Docker, ensuring the same results across different environments.

---

## Deliverables

- **Processed Output Files**:  
   - `summary_statistics.csv`: Table with total and average species count per phylum.  
   - `total_species_count_chart.png`: Bar chart visualization.

- **Docker Environment**: Pre-configured container for running the pipeline without
- dependency issues, including solutions for host permission problems.

- **Sample Dataset**: A sample input file (`taxonomic_data.csv`) for testing the
- pipeline functionality.

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: This README and in-script comments to guide users
- through usage and customization.

## Prerequisites

1. **Docker**  
   Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.  
   Minimum required version: **Docker 20.10.0** or later.  
   [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if not already installed.

---

## Dependencies Encapsulated in the Docker Container

The following Python libraries are pre-installed and configured inside the Docker container:

- **`pandas`**: For processing tabular data and performing data analysis.
- **`matplotlib`**: For creating visualizations.
- **`numpy`**: For efficient numerical computations.

---

## Usage

## Full Workflow Sequence

Follow these steps to run the taxonomic analysis pipeline, retrieve the results, and clean up the environment.

---

## Step 1: Remove Any Conflicting Container

Ensure no previous container with the same name exists before running the pipeline.

```bash
docker rm -f taxo_output 2>/dev/null || true

---

### **Step 2: Build the Docker Image**

Build the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile`. This creates a reproducible
environment for running the pipeline.

```bash
docker build -t taxonomic_analysis .

---

## Step 3: Run the Container

Run the analysis pipeline inside the container. Do **not** use the `--rm` flag here, as the
container must persist temporarily for file extraction.

```bash
docker run --name taxo_output taxonomic_analysis

---

## Step 4: Copy the Output Files to the Host Machine

After the pipeline completes, copy the generated results from the containerâ€™s `/app/output` directory
 to a local `output/` folder on the host machine.

```bash
docker cp taxo_output:/app/output ./output

---

## Step 5: Clean Up - Remove the Container After Copying Files

Once the results have been extracted, remove the container to free up resources.

```bash
docker rm taxo_output

---

## Step 6: Verify Output Files

List the contents of the `output/` directory to verify that the results have been successfully copied.

```bash
echo "Output files:"
ls -lh output/

---

## Outputs

After running the pipeline, the following files will be available in the `output/` directory:

1. **`summary_statistics.csv`**  
   - CSV file containing total and average species counts per phylum.

2. **`total_species_count_chart.png`**  
   - Bar chart visualizing the total species count per phylum.

---
## Debugging Notes

### 1. **Host Directory Permission Issues**

If you face permission errors when mounting a directory, avoid mounting the volume and instead copy the
results using the `docker cp` command as shown above.

---

### 2. **Rebuilding the Image**

If any file is modified, rebuild the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t taxonomic_analysis .

---

## Summarized Workflow

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/carlosbuss1/meta_dockerflow.git
cd meta_dockerflow

# Build the image
docker build -t taxonomic_analysis .

# Run the analysis
docker run --name taxo_output taxonomic_analysis

# Retrieve the output files
docker cp taxo_output:/app/output ./output

# Remove the container
docker rm taxo_output
